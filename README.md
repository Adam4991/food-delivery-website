# 🚀 React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## 📦 Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses SWC for Fast Refresh
